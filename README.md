My SciTE installation - not for discussion here

Hi

As requested a zip of my SciTE windows installation.

I am now using the Single file 64-bit executable called Sc1 (3.7M) that does not need any DLL or properties files as these are linked into the executable. 

However, I am renaming SC533.exe to SciTE.exe so my various scripts still work.

I have included hunspell.exe into the installation.
  
There are some other utilities also with credits.
     
This is portable, but uses a SciTE_USERHOME env variable
e.g. setx SciTE_USERHOME P:\MyProfile\editor
        
Kind Regards Gavin

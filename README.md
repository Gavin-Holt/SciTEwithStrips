Download of my SciTE windows setup - not for discussion

Hi

As requested a zip of my SciTE windows installation.
 
I have moved hunspell.exe into the installation.
  
There are some other utilities also with credits.
     
This is portable, but uses a SciTE_USERHOME env variable
e.g. setx SciTE_USERHOME P:\MyPrograms\EDITORS\Scite\user

TODO: Use MultiMark.exe and LuaCheck6.exe
        
Kind Regards Gavin

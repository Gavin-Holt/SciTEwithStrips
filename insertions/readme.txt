These files contain compleations with comments

I have named them all API.* so they will highlight properly

The comments will be stripped - as long as they use the comment characters used by the comment plugin.
If this is not happening check for magic characters in the comment delimiter

API.micro a list of micro functions+options for cmdfzf
API.lua includes many micro lua functions

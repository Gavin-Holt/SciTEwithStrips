# Universal Keyboard Shortcuts (UKS)
## Introduction

Instead of learning and re-learning keyboard shortcuts I am "_on an mission_" to force all my editors to respond to the same keystrokes.

This may sound a little limiting, and there are some actions I cannot achieve in some software. However, using some tricks most things are possible:

* Use Autohotkey to translate keyboard/mouse input for each target program.
* Use Reshacker to change PE executable keyboard accelerators.
* Use the scripting capabilities of each target program.
* Call external tools for some advanced actions (fzf, findstr, winGREP)

## Actions and Workflow

I don't hate the mouse, but lots of clicking makes my pisiform bone hurt!

There are several situations where a keyboard interface can avoid many clicks:

* Word focused actions
* Moving the cursor (shift to select)
* Move and act
* Searching / Navigating
* Jumping to next and previous
* Command alternatives to dialog boxes
* Activating options
* Smart editing (if you grok vi!)
* Selecting from a long list

Less often used actions are not assigned a shortcut and can be accessed from the menu or preferably from a command line.

In my trials of many editors, there are some editing actions I find so useful I have adopted them.
